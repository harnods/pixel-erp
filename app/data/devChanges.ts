/**
 * Dev change registry — the "what changed & where" annotations engineers see via
 * the DevChangesOverlay (a pulse + coachmark on each changed element).
 *
 * How it works:
 *  1. Tag the changed element in the template with `data-devchange="<id>"`.
 *  2. Add an entry here keyed by that same `<id>` with a human-readable summary.
 * The overlay scans the current page for `[data-devchange]`, looks the id up here,
 * and draws a pulsing marker + coachmark anchored to the element. No brittle CSS
 * selectors, no per-route wiring — the marker lives wherever the attribute lives.
 *
 * Keep entries newest-first. `date` is ISO (YYYY-MM-DD); convert relative dates.
